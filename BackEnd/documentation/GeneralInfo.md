Documentation contains subfolders that are named based on the version of the application.
Subfoldes structure:
    -diagrams
        -mainDiagram.
    -content
        -mainDiagram.md

Diagrams folder includes schemas that will offer , hopefully, a clear undestanding of the project.
The diagrams were made using an online tool draw.io ( https://app.diagrams.net/ ). In order to open the drawings, you need to use the online tool.
